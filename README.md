# Kaggle-Home_Credit_Default_Risk
This repository contains my python code for Kaggle's most challenging competition so far(09/01/18) with 7200 teams conducted by Home Credit to predict Default Risks. It helped me secure top 1%  and can secure 30th place in private leaderboard with a minor tweak in my final submission.
